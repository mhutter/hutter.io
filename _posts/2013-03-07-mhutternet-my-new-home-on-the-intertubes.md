After <del>months</del> years of procrastinating, I finally built this thing.

While some content is still missing (like the [About Page](/about/)) and parts are falling off here and there, I'm proud to be at least _somewhere_.

Thanks to the help of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [many](http://erjjones.github.com/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/) helpful [people](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) out there I did most of the "work" in just 1 or 2 days.

(Why did I always want to build my own Website with Rails?)

While I work on the small things (like comments and so) feel free to contact me at manuel.hutter at gmail.com or a social network. (see header)

BTW, is it a bad habit to [misuse a Issue tracking system as a ToDo-List](https://github.com/mhutter/mhutter.github.com/issues)?
