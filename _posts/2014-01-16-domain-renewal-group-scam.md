So you got a letter from the "Domain Renewal Group" regarding one of your domains? You have no idea who they are?

Well, just ignore the letter. They're a bunch of dicks.

## Background

Apparently, the Domain Renewal Group's core business is to scam people into transferring their domains to them and then charging a shitload of money for their "service". **As long as you just ignore the letter, your domains are safe!**
