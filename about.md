My name is Manuel Hutter. I'm a Linux System Engineer / Software Engineer from Switzerland. Here on hutter.io I sometimes write about stuff I think others could find interesting - but mostly about stuff I would forget otherwise!

I do a lot of [programmering](https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/644489270913175553) in my spare time. You can find most of this stuff up on Github: {% include icon-github.html username=site.author.github %}

If you have the twitters, you can follow me at {% include icon-twitter.html username=site.twitter.username %}. I'm also active on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/405454/mhutter), where I also have a [public CV](https://stackoverflow.com/cv/mhutter).

If you want to email me... well, you know my first name, and you know which domain this site is hosted on ;-)
